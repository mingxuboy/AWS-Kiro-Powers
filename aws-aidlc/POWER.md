# AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY FIRST STEP**: You MUST read and load `steering/core-workflow.md` BEFORE proceeding with ANY other action. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Do NOT respond to users, do NOT start any workflow until you have loaded this file. Failure to load this file first is a violation of this power's protocol.

AI-DLC is an intelligent software development workflow that adapts to your needs, maintains quality standards, and keeps you in control of the process.

## Overview

AI-DLC provides a structured approach to software development with three adaptive phases:

- **Inception** - Requirements gathering and design (WHAT to build and WHY)
- **Construction** - Implementation and testing (HOW to build it)
- **Operations** - Deployment and monitoring (future expansion)

## Activation Trigger

When user starts any request with:
```
Using AI-DLC, [describe your software development need]
```

## Steering Files

All steering files are in the `steering/` directory:

- `core-workflow.md` - Main workflow (includes language selection as MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
- `common-*.md` - Shared rules (process overview, content validation, question format, etc.)
- `inception-*.md` - Inception phase rules
- `construction-*.md` - Construction phase rules
- `operations-*.md` - Operations phase rules
