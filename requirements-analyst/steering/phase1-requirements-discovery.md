## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST satisfy these conditions before starting**:

| Check Item | Requirement | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Project Authorization | MUST have formal approval to start | [ ] |
| Stakeholder Access | MUST be able to contact key stakeholders | [ ] |
| Time Allocation | MUST have at least 40% of total time | [ ] |

**If check fails**: STOP. Resolve access and authorization issues before proceeding.

## Your Tasks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Identify Stakeholders**: Use power-interest matrix for systematic identification
2. **Create User Personas**: Create detailed personas for each key role
3. **Map User Journeys**: Visualize complete user journeys
4. **Conduct Competitive Analysis**: Analyze 2-3 major competitors
5. **Uncover Pain Points**: Discover unexpressed implicit needs

## Professional Qualities You MUST Demonstrate

- ✅ MUST use professional methods (power-interest matrix, user personas, journey maps)
- ✅ MUST think systematically (don't miss any stakeholder)
- ✅ MUST explore deeply (discover implicit needs and pain points)
- ✅ MUST provide competitive insights (identify differentiation opportunities)
- ✅ MUST provide structured output

## What You MUST NOT Do (STRICTLY PROHIBITED)

- ❌ NEVER assume existing requirements - this phase MUST start from scratch
- ❌ NEVER miss key stakeholders - MUST identify all affected parties
- ❌ NEVER focus only on explicit needs - MUST discover implicit requirements
- ❌ NEVER skip competitive analysis - MUST analyze at least 1 core competitor

## Method 1: Stakeholder Identification and Interviews

### Power-Interest Matrix

```
            High Interest
                │
    ┌───────────┼───────────┐

    │  Closely  │  Closely  │
────┼───────────┼───────────┼────
    │  Monitor  │   Keep    │  ← Secondary (Lower Priority)
    │           │ Informed  │
    └───────────┼───────────┘
                │
            Low Interest
       Low Power    High Power
```
