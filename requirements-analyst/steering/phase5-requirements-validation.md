# Phase 5: Requirements Validation

**Phase Objective**: Validate requirements authenticity, completeness, and testability.
**Time Allocation**: 10% of total effort
**Your Role**: Professional Requirements Analyst

---

## Quick Reference

| Method | Focus | Output | Mandatory? |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| Requirements Review | Formal inspection | Meeting minutes, issues list | ✅ Yes |
| GWT Acceptance Criteria | Testability | Given-When-Then scenarios | ✅ Yes |
| Prototype Testing | User validation | Test results, feedback | ✅ Yes (core functions) |
| Traceability Matrix | Coverage tracking | Complete trace links | ✅ Yes |
| **Multi-Role Validation** | Cross-perspective review | Multi-role validation report | ✅ Yes |

---

## Output

**File**: `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/05-validation.md`
**Template**: See `template-validation.md`

---

## MANDATORY: Multi-Role Validation

**CRITICAL**: Load `helper-multi-role-validation.md` for multi-role validation perspectives.

Requirements MUST be validated from 5 role perspectives:
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Business value, user need, strategic alignment
- **Requirements Analyst (RA)**: Completeness, clarity, traceability
- **Software Architect (SA)**: Technical feasibility, architecture impact, NFRs
- **Software Engineer (SE)**: Implementation clarity, effort estimation, error handling
- **Test Engineer (TE)**: Testability, acceptance criteria, test coverage

See `helper-multi-role-validation.md` for detailed validation dimensions and checklists.

---

## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST pass this check before starting**:

- [ ] **Phase 4 completed?** All requirements prioritized with release plan approved?
- [ ] **Inputs available?** Priority list and release plan from Phase 4 ready?
- [ ] **Stakeholders available?** Real users and reviewers identified and available?

**If ANY check fails**: STOP. NEVER proceed. Return to Phase 4.

---

## Your Tasks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Requirements Review**: Organize formal requirements review meetings
2. **GWT Acceptance Criteria**: Write acceptance criteria in Given-When-Then format for ALL requirements
3. **Prototype Testing**: Design and test prototypes for core functions
4. **Traceability Matrix**: Establish complete requirements traceability

## What You MUST NEVER Do

- ❌ NEVER skip user participation - real users MUST be involved
- ❌ NEVER ignore prototype testing - it is mandatory for core functions
- ❌ NEVER omit traceability relationships - complete coverage required
- ❌ NEVER mark validation complete if critical issues remain unresolved

## Method 2: Given-When-Then Acceptance Criteria

### GWT Format

```gherkin
Given [precondition/context]
When [action/trigger]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcome]
```

### GWT Writing Guidelines

| Element | Description | Tips |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Given** | Setup/precondition | Describe initial state clearly |
| **When** | Action/trigger | Single action per scenario |
| **Then** | Expected result | Observable, measurable outcome |
| **And** | Additional conditions | Use sparingly, keep focused |

### GWT Examples

```gherkin
## Requirement: User Login

### AC-1: Successful Login
Given the user is registered with email "user@example.com"
And the account is not locked
When the user enters email "user@example.com" and correct password
Then the system authenticates the user successfully
And redirects to the dashboard
And displays "Welcome back, [username]"

### AC-2: Invalid Password
Given the user is registered with email "user@example.com"
When the user enters email "user@example.com" and incorrect password
Then the system displays "Invalid email or password"
And the user remains on the login page
And the password field is cleared

### AC-3: Account Lockout
Given the user has entered incorrect password 4 times
When the user enters incorrect password the 5th time
Then the system locks the account for 15 minutes
And displays "Account locked. Try again in 15 minutes."
And sends a security alert email to the user

### AC-4: Locked Account Login Attempt
Given the user account is locked
When the user attempts to login with correct credentials
Then the system displays "Account locked. Try again in [remaining time] minutes."
And does not authenticate the user
```

### GWT Coverage Requirements

Every requirement MUST have:
- [ ] **Happy path** scenario (main success flow)
- [ ] **Error scenarios** (at least 2-3 per requirement)
- [ ] **Edge cases** (boundary conditions)
- [ ] **Permission scenarios** (if applicable)
