# Phase 5: Requirements Validation

**Phase Objective**: Validate requirements through 5 critical dimensions to ensure they are ready for implementation.
**Time Allocation**: 15% of total effort
**Your Role**: Professional Requirements Analyst

---

## Quick Reference

| Validation Dimension | Focus | Key Question |
|---------------------|-------|--------------|
| **Authenticity** | Real need | Is this a genuine user/business need? |
| **Completeness** | Coverage | Are all aspects fully specified? |
| **Consistency** | Coherence | Are requirements conflict-free? |
| **Feasibility** | Achievability | Is it technically and economically viable? |
| **Verifiability** | Testability | Can we objectively verify it's met? |

## MANDATORY: Multi-Role Validation

Requirements MUST be validated from 5 role perspectives (see `helper-multi-role-validation.md`):
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Business value, user need, strategic alignment
- **Requirements Analyst (RA)**: Completeness, clarity, traceability
- **Software Architect (SA)**: Technical feasibility, architecture impact, NFRs
- **Software Engineer (SE)**: Implementation clarity, effort estimation, error handling
- **Test Engineer (TE)**: Testability, acceptance criteria, test coverage

---

## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST pass this check before starting**:

- [ ] **Phase 4 completed?** Verify `clarification.md` exists with resolved ambiguities
- [ ] **Requirements documented?** All requirements in `requirements.md` are clarified
- [ ] **Stakeholders available?** Reviewers from different roles identified

**If ANY check fails**: STOP. Return to Phase 4.

---

## Dimension 1: Authenticity Validation (真实性验证)

### Purpose

Verify that requirements represent **genuine user needs** and **real business problems**, not assumptions or "nice-to-haves".

### Validation Criteria

| Criterion | Question | Evidence Required |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **User Origin** | Did this come from actual users? | User interviews, feedback logs |
| **Problem Evidence** | Is there proof the problem exists? | Support tickets, user complaints, analytics |
| **Business Alignment** | Does it support business goals? | Business case, strategic plan link |
| **Stakeholder Confirmation** | Have stakeholders validated this need? | Sign-off, meeting minutes |
| **Usage Frequency** | How often will this be used? | Usage projections, market data |

### Authenticity Checklist

```markdown
## Authenticity Validation Checklist

### Source Verification
- [ ] Requirement traced to specific user/stakeholder request
- [ ] Original request documented (interview, ticket, email)
- [ ] Not based solely on assumptions or competitor features

### Problem Validation
- [ ] Problem statement clearly articulated
- [ ] Evidence of problem exists (metrics, complaints, observations)
- [ ] Impact of NOT solving this problem quantified

### Stakeholder Validation
- [ ] Business sponsor confirmed the need
- [ ] End users confirmed this solves their problem
- [ ] No stakeholder objections recorded

### Business Value
- [ ] Clear business benefit articulated
- [ ] ROI or value proposition defined
- [ ] Aligned with product strategy/roadmap
```

### Red Flags (Authenticity Issues)

| Red Flag | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 🚩 "Users might want..." | Assumption without evidence | Conduct user research |
| 🚩 "Competitor has it" | Feature copying without validation | Validate with YOUR users |
| 🚩 No stakeholder source | Origin unclear | Trace back to source |
| 🚩 "Future-proofing" | Speculative requirement | Defer or validate need |

---

## Dimension 2: Completeness Validation (完整性验证)

### Purpose

Ensure requirements are **fully specified** with no missing information, gaps, or TBDs.

### Completeness Model

## Dimension 3: Consistency Validation (一致性验证)

### Purpose

Ensure requirements are **internally coherent** with no conflicts, contradictions, or ambiguous overlaps.

### Consistency Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Internal** | No conflicts within same requirement | Field is both "required" and "optional" |
| **Inter-requirement** | No conflicts between requirements | REQ-1 says A, REQ-2 says NOT A |
| **Terminology** | Same term means same thing everywhere | "User" vs "Customer" vs "Client" |
| **Data** | Data definitions consistent | Field length differs in different places |
| **Temporal** | No timeline conflicts | Deadline A before deadline B, but B is prerequisite |

### Consistency Checklist

```markdown
## Consistency Validation Checklist

### Terminology Consistency
- [ ] Glossary defined and maintained
- [ ] Same concepts use same terms
- [ ] No synonyms used interchangeably
- [ ] Acronyms expanded on first use

### Data Consistency
- [ ] Field names consistent across requirements
- [ ] Data types consistent for same fields
- [ ] Validation rules consistent
- [ ] Format specifications consistent (dates, numbers, etc.)

### Logic Consistency
- [ ] No contradictory business rules
- [ ] No conflicting conditions
- [ ] Priority order logical (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] Precedence rules clear when conflicts possible

## Dimension 5: Verifiability Validation (可验证性验证)

### Purpose

Ensure every requirement can be **objectively verified** through testing, measurement, or inspection.

### Verifiability Criteria

| Criterion | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Measurable** | Has quantifiable target | "Response time < 2 seconds" |
| **Observable** | Can see/detect outcome | "Button changes to green" |
| **Testable** | Can create test case | Clear pass/fail criteria |
| **Demonstrable** | Can show to stakeholder | Working prototype possible |

### 5.1 Vague Terms Check (MANDATORY)

**Scan ALL requirements** for ambiguous terms that prevent objective verification.

| Category | Vague Terms to Detect | Quantified Alternative |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Performance** | fast, quick, responsive, efficient | "< 2s response time", "95th percentile < 500ms" |
| **Usability** | user-friendly, easy, intuitive, simple | "Task completion rate > 90%", "< 3 clicks" |
| **Quality** | reliable, stable, robust, secure, safe | "99.9% uptime", "OWASP Top 10 compliant" |
| **Flexibility** | flexible, configurable, extensible | "Supports N configuration options" |
| **Scale** | scalable, many, few, large, small | "10,000 concurrent users", "1TB storage" |

**Action Required**: For each vague term found, provide quantified replacement recommendation.

### 5.2 Non-Quantified Standards Check (MANDATORY)

**Scan ALL requirements** for standards lacking measurable metrics.

| Standard Type | Non-Quantified Example | Quantified Example |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Time** | "fast loading", "quick response" | "Page load < 3s on 4G", "API response < 200ms" |
| **Capacity** | "support many users", "handle large data" | "10,000 concurrent users", "100GB dataset" |
| **Availability** | "high availability", "always available" | "99.9% uptime", "RTO < 1 hour" |
| **Quality** | "low error rate", "high accuracy" | "Error rate < 0.1%", "Accuracy > 95%" |
| **Performance** | "good throughput", "low latency" | "1000 TPS", "P99 latency < 100ms" |

**Action Required**: For each non-quantified standard, specify measurable metric with threshold.
