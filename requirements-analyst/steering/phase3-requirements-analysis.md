# Phase 3: Requirements Analysis

**Phase Objective**: Deep analysis of dependencies, feasibility, and implementation approaches.
**Time Allocation**: 20% of total effort
**Your Role**: Professional Requirements Analyst

---

## Quick Reference

| Method | Focus | Output | When to Use |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| User Story Mapping | User activities and priorities | Story map with MVP | All projects |
| Use Case Analysis | Actor-system interactions | Use case documents | Complex interactions |
| Event Storming | Domain events and commands | Domain model | Complex business logic |
| DDD Strategic Design | Bounded contexts | Context map | Large-scale systems |

---

## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST pass this check before starting**:

- [ ] **Phase 2 completed?** All requirements classified and categorized?
- [ ] **Inputs available?** Value sorting matrix and prioritization from Phase 2 ready?
- [ ] **Unclear items identified?** Any requirements needing deeper clarification flagged?

**If ANY check fails**: STOP. NEVER proceed. Return to Phase 2.

---

## Your Tasks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **User Story Mapping**: Create complete user story maps
2. **Use Case Analysis**: Draw main use case diagrams and write use case documents
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Map requirement dependencies and identify conflicts
4. **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate technical feasibility and risks

## Professional Qualities You MUST Demonstrate

- ✅ Use professional methods (user story mapping, use case analysis, event storming)
- ✅ Deep analysis (requirement dependencies, technical feasibility)
- ✅ Domain modeling (identify bounded contexts, aggregates)
- ✅ Visual output (story maps, use case diagrams, domain models)

## What You MUST NEVER Do

- ❌ NEVER be superficial - deep analysis is mandatory
- ❌ NEVER ignore requirement dependencies - document all relationships
- ❌ NEVER skip technical feasibility assessment - it is required
- ❌ NEVER force-fit DDD just to use it (DDD suits complex business; simple projects can use simplified models)

## Method 1: User Story Mapping

### User Story Format

```
As a [role],
I want [feature/capability],
So that [business value/benefit].
```

### INVEST Criteria

Each user story MUST be:
- **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Delivers value to user/business
- **E**stimable: Can be sized/estimated
- **S**mall: Fits within a sprint
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

```

### Domain Events Identified

## Method 4: Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Types

| Type | Description | Example | Risk Level |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Mandatory** | Must complete A before B | Login before checkout | High |
| **Optional** | A enhances B | Search filters enhance search | Low |
| **Conflicting** | A and B cannot coexist | Two auth methods | Critical |
| **External** | Depends on outside system | Payment gateway | High |

### Dependency Matrix

```markdown
## Requirements Dependency Matrix

| Req ID | Depends On | Dependency Type | Impact if Delayed |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| REQ-005 | REQ-001, REQ-002 | Mandatory | Blocks entire feature |
| REQ-008 | REQ-005 | Mandatory | Blocks payment flow |
| REQ-010 | External API | External | Risk: API availability |
| REQ-012 | REQ-003 | Optional | Degraded experience |

### Dependency Graph
```
REQ-001 ──┐
          ├──► REQ-005 ──► REQ-008 ──► REQ-011
REQ-002 ──┘        │
                   └──► REQ-009
REQ-003 ──────────────► REQ-012 (optional)
```

### Critical Path

|------|--------------|------------|
| Circular dependency | [List] | [Solution] |
| External dependency | [List] | [Fallback plan] |
```
