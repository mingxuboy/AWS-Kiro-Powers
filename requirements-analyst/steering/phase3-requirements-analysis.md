## MANDATORY: Diagram and Documentation Standards

**CRITICAL**: You MUST load and follow `helper-diagram-standards.md` BEFORE creating any diagrams or documentation. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### Expression Priority (MUST FOLLOW)

```
1st Priority: Diagram (Visual representation)
    └── 2nd Priority: UML Diagram (Standard notation)
        └── 3rd Priority: Mermaid Syntax (Generation method)
```

**Rule**: ALWAYS prefer diagrams over text/tables. When using diagrams, ALWAYS prefer UML. When generating UML, ALWAYS use Mermaid syntax.

| Expression Method | Priority | When to Use |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| **UML Diagram (Mermaid)** | 🥇 Highest | Default choice for all requirements |
| **Other Diagrams (Mermaid)** | 🥈 Second | When UML is not applicable |
| **Table + Diagram** | 🥉 Third | Supplementary details only |
| **Text/Table only** | ❌ Avoid | Only when diagram is impossible |

### Key Rules Summary

1. **UML Use Case Diagram**:
   - Actors: stick figure icon
   - Use Cases: ellipse shape
   - System Boundary: dashed rectangle
   - Relationships: `<<include>>` and `<<extend>>` stereotypes
   - ❌ PROHIBITED: Simple flowcharts instead of UML

2. **Business Process (Activity Diagram)**:
   - Core user flows MUST use UML Activity Diagram
   - Tables alone are NOT sufficient
   - Parallel processing MUST use fork/join or `par` syntax

3. **Use Case Main Flow (Sequence Diagram)**:
   - Main flows MUST use Sequence Diagram
   - Include all participants: User, UI, System, Agent, Database
   - Parallel execution MUST use `par` syntax
   - ✅ ALWAYS accompany tables with Sequence Diagrams (tables alone are insufficient)

4. **Document Format**:
   - Each analysis item on separate line
   - Key terms in **bold**
   - Consistent indentation
   - Clear visual hierarchy

5. **Diagram Quality**:
   - Use Mermaid syntax for all diagrams
   - Apply color coding for element types
   - Complex processes MUST be decomposed

---

## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST pass this check before starting**:

- [ ] **Phase 2 completed?** Verify `02-sort.md` exists with value sorting matrix
- [ ] **Inputs available?** Confirm prioritization (MoSCoW/RICE) is complete
- [ ] **Unclear items identified?** List requirements flagged for clarification
- [ ] **Helper file loaded?** Load `helper-diagram-standards.md` for diagram rules

**If ANY check fails**: STOP. NEVER proceed. Return to Phase 2 or load required files.

---

## Your Tasks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **User Story Mapping**: Create complete user story maps
2. **Use Case Analysis**: Draw main use case diagrams and write use case documents
3. **Success Criteria Definition**: Define measurable success criteria for each requirement
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Map requirement dependencies and identify conflicts
5. **Feasibility Assessment**: Evaluate technical feasibility and risks

## Professional Qualities You MUST Demonstrate

- ✅ Use professional methods (user story mapping, use case analysis, event storming)
- ✅ Deep analysis (requirement dependencies, technical feasibility)
- ✅ Domain modeling (identify bounded contexts, aggregates)
- ✅ Visual output (story maps, use case diagrams, domain models)

## What You MUST NEVER Do

- ❌ NEVER be superficial - deep analysis is mandatory
- ❌ NEVER ignore requirement dependencies - document all relationships
- ❌ NEVER skip technical feasibility assessment - it is required
- ❌ NEVER force-fit DDD just to use it (DDD suits complex business; simple projects can use simplified models)

---

## Method 1: User Story Mapping

**OUTPUT TEMPLATE**: Use `template-analysis.md` for output format.

### Core User Activity Flow (UML Activity Diagram)

**MUST use `stateDiagram-v2` for user activity flows:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Browse: Start

    Browse --> Select
    Select --> Decision1

    state Decision1 <<choice>>
    Decision1 --> Purchase: [Add to Cart]
    Decision1 --> Browse: [Continue Shopping]

    Purchase --> Payment
    Payment --> Decision2

    state Decision2 <<choice>>
    Decision2 --> Receive: [Success]
    Decision2 --> Purchase: [Retry]

    Receive --> Support
    Support --> [*]: End

    Browse: 浏览商品 (Browse)
    Select: 选择商品 (Select)
    Purchase: 下单购买 (Purchase)
    Payment: 支付处理 (Payment)
    Receive: 收货确认 (Receive)
    Support: 售后支持 (Support)
```

**Activity Diagram Elements:**
| Element | UML Standard | Mermaid Syntax |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Start Node | Filled circle | `[*] -->` |
| End Node | Bull's eye | `--> [*]` |
| Activity | Rounded rectangle | `StateName: Label` |
| Decision | Diamond | `state Name <<choice>>` |
| Transition | Arrow with guard | `--> Target: [condition]` |
| Fork/Join | Thick bar | `state Name { ... }` |

### User Story Format

```
As a [role],
I want [feature/capability],
So that [business value/benefit].
```

### INVEST Criteria

Each user story MUST be:
- **I**ndependent: Can be developed separately
- **N**egotiable: Details can be discussed
- **V**aluable: Delivers value to user/business
- **E**stimable: Can be sized/estimated
- **S**mall: Fits within a sprint
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

### User Story Map Visualization

> **Note**: Story Map is an Agile visualization technique (not UML). Use `graph TB` with subgraphs for matrix layout.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Activities["USER ACTIVITY FLOW →"]
        direction LR
        A1["📦 Activity 1<br/>Browse"]
        A2["🔍 Activity 2<br/>Select"]
        A3["💳 Activity 3<br/>Purchase"]
        A4["📬 Activity 4<br/>Receive"]
        A5["🛠️ Activity 5<br/>Support"]
        A1 --> A2 --> A3 --> A4 --> A5
    end

    subgraph MVP["MVP Release"]
        direction LR

| **S**pecific | Clear and unambiguous | "Page loads in under 2 seconds" not "Page loads fast" |
| **M**easurable | Quantifiable metric | "95% of users complete checkout" |
| **A**chievable | Realistic given constraints | Consider technical limitations |
| **R**elevant | Aligned with business goals | Ties to user value |
| **T**ime-bound | Has defined timeframe | "Within first 30 days of launch" |

### Success Criteria Categories

| Category | Focus | Example Metrics |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **Functional** | Feature behavior | Task completion rate, error rate |
| **Performance** | Speed and efficiency | Response time, throughput |
| **Usability** | User experience | Task success rate, time-on-task |
| **Business** | Business outcomes | Conversion rate, revenue impact |
| **Quality** | System quality | Defect density, uptime |

### Success Criteria Template

```markdown
## Success Criteria: [Requirement/Feature ID]

### SC-001: [Criterion Name]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Requirement** | REQ-XXX / US-XXX |

| **Target** | [Quantified goal] |
| **Baseline** | [Current state, if applicable] |
| **Measurement Method** | [How to measure] |
| **Verification Point** | [When to verify] |

**Definition of Success**:
> [Clear statement of what success looks like]

**Definition of Failure**:
> [Clear statement of what constitutes failure]
```

|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Mandatory** | Must complete A before B | Login before checkout | High |
| **Optional** | A enhances B | Search filters enhance search | Low |
| **Conflicting** | A and B cannot coexist | Two auth methods | Critical |
| **External** | Depends on outside system | Payment gateway | High |

### Dependency Matrix

```markdown
## Requirements Dependency Matrix

| Req ID | Depends On | Dependency Type | Impact if Delayed |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| REQ-005 | REQ-001, REQ-002 | Mandatory | Blocks entire feature |
| REQ-008 | REQ-005 | Mandatory | Blocks payment flow |
| REQ-010 | External API | External | Risk: API availability |
| REQ-012 | REQ-003 | Optional | Degraded experience |
