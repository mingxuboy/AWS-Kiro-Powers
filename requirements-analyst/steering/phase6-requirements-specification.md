# Phase 6: Requirements Specification

**Phase Objective**: Formalize validated requirements into unified documentation, establish requirements baseline.
**Time Allocation**: 10% of total effort
**Your Role**: Professional Requirements Analyst

---

## Quick Reference

| Deliverable | Format | Purpose | Mandatory? |
|-------------|--------|---------|------------|
| PRD Document | Markdown/PDF | Complete product requirements | ✅ Yes |
| API Specification | OpenAPI YAML | API contract definition | If API-heavy |
| BDD Scenarios | Gherkin | Executable test scenarios | ✅ Yes |
| Requirements Baseline | Version controlled | Change management | ✅ Yes |
| Traceability Matrix | Table | Requirements tracking | ✅ Yes |

**Baseline Establishment Process**:
1. Requirements Freeze → 2. Formal Review → 3. Stakeholder Approval → 4. Version Release → 5. Change Control

---

## Pre-Check (GATE CHECK)

**MUST satisfy these conditions before starting**:

| Check Item | Requirement | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 5 Complete | ALL Phase 5 validation criteria satisfied | [ ] |
| All Requirements Validated | Validated and approved requirements | [ ] |
| Stakeholder Alignment | Consensus on requirements | [ ] |

**If check fails**: STOP. Return to Phase 5 and complete validation.

---

## Your Tasks (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **PRD Document**: Write complete Product Requirements Document
2. **API Specification**: Define API design document (if applicable)
3. **BDD Scenarios**: Write BDD test scenarios in Gherkin format
4. **Requirements Baseline**: Establish formal requirements baseline with version control

## What You MUST NEVER Do

- ❌ NEVER use non-standard formats - MUST follow industry standards
- ❌ NEVER omit version control - MUST establish baseline
- ❌ NEVER ignore change management processes - MUST define change procedures
- ❌ NEVER over-pursue document perfection while ignoring actual value

## Method 3: BDD Scenarios (Gherkin)

### Feature File Template

```gherkin
# File: features/user_login.feature

@authentication @priority-high
Feature: User Login
  As a registered user
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access my account and features

  Background:
    Given the system is available
    And the user database contains test users

  @happy-path
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com" and password "SecurePass123"
    And the user account is active and not locked
    When the user navigates to the login page
    And enters email "user@example.com"
    And enters password "SecurePass123"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And should see "Welcome back" message
    And a session should be created

  @error-handling
  Scenario: Login fails with invalid password
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
    When the user attempts to login with email "user@example.com"
    And enters incorrect password "WrongPassword"
    Then the system should display "Invalid email or password"
    And the user should remain on the login page
    And no session should be created

  @security
  Scenario: Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
    Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
    And the user has failed login 4 times
    When the user attempts to login with incorrect password
    Then the account should be locked for 15 minutes
    And the system should display "Account locked. Try again in 15 minutes."
    And a security notification should be sent to the user's email

  @security
  Scenario Outline: Password validation rules
    Given a user is on the registration page
    When the user enters password "<password>"
    Then the system should <result>

    Examples:
      | password      | result                                    |
      | short         | display "Password must be at least 8 characters" |
      | NoNumbers!    | display "Password must contain a number"  |
      | nonumbers123  | display "Password must contain uppercase" |
      | ValidPass123! | accept the password                       |

  @edge-case
  Scenario: Login attempt with locked account
    Given a user exists with email "locked@example.com"
    And the account is locked with 10 minutes remaining
    When the user attempts to login with correct credentials
    Then the system should display "Account locked. Try again in 10 minutes."
    And should not create a session
```

## Method 4: Requirements Baseline Management

### Version Numbering

**Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

| Component | When to Increment | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **MAJOR** | Incompatible changes, major scope changes | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 |
| **MINOR** | New features, backward compatible | 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes, clarifications | 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 |

### Baseline Record Template

```markdown
## Requirements Baseline Record

### Baseline Information
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Baseline Version** | v1.0.0 |
| **Baseline Date** | [Date] |
| **Approved By** | [Names] |
| **Status** | Active |

### Included Requirements
| Req ID Range | Count | Category |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| REQ-001 ~ REQ-050 | 50 | Functional |
| NFR-001 ~ NFR-015 | 15 | Non-Functional |
| **Total** | **65** | |

### Change Control Process
1. **Change Request**: Submit via [system/form]
2. **Impact Analysis**: Technical and schedule assessment
3. **CCB Review**: Change Control Board approval
4. **Implementation**: Approved changes implemented
5. **Documentation**: Requirements updated, new baseline

### Change Request Template
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **CR ID** | CR-XXX |
| **Requester** | [Name] |
| **Date** | [Date] |
| **Requirements Affected** | [List] |
| **Change Description** | [Description] |
| **Justification** | [Why needed] |
| **Impact Assessment** | [Schedule, cost, risk] |
| **Decision** | Approved / Rejected / Deferred |
| **Approved By** | [Names] |

### Version History
| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1.0.0 | [Date] | [Name] | Initial baseline | [Names] |
| 1.0.1 | [Date] | [Name] | [Changes] | [Names] |
| 1.1.0 | [Date] | [Name] | [Changes] | [Names] |
```

## Congratulations!

You have completed all 6 phases of requirements engineering.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to design phase with:
- Approved PRD as input
- BDD scenarios for test-driven development
- API specifications for development contracts
- Traceability matrix for ongoing tracking

**Remember**: Requirements specification is not the end, but the starting point of continuous evolution. Establish good change management mechanisms to ensure requirements documentation always reflects the latest understanding.
